A simple Python program that calculates a person's age using the datetime library.
The user inputs a birth date in the format yyyy/mm/dd.
The program validates the date, checks whether it is a real calendar date, and prints the age based on a fixed current date: 2019/02/01.

If the input date is invalid (e.g., month > 12, day > 31, or a non-existent date), the program prints "WRONG".

This project is ideal for beginners learning:

Error handling with try/except
